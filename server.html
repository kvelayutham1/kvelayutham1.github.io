        <h3>Server and Deployment Skills</h3>
            Servers are basically computers that store website files and other resources like databases.
        <br>
        <h4>Server Setup</h4>
           To make a website accessible publicly on the internet, it needs to be installed on a server. Once you have your domain name and server space, it’s time to set up the site on the server. The first thing is to direct the domain name to the server’s unique IP address. Then you need to set up website files and finally the database and other configurations.
        <br>

        <h4>Deployment Tools</h4>
            To get files from your own computer up to your server, you need a protocol. This is basically a method of transporting files or other data to and from a server.
        <br>
        <br>
            The deployment tool stores your FTP/SFTP settings, and when a change is pushed in Git to the master branch, the tool will transfer the files for you. So, there is no need to remember which files you changed, reducing the number of mistakes you make.
        <br>
        <br>
        So these are some of the important guidelines and skills that you need for web development. With this, we have come to the end of our web development tutorial. I hope you understood the different aspects of website development and the different skills you need to learn.
