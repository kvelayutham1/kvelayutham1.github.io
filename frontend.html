        <h3>Front End Skills</h3>
            A website is basically a collection of various webpages that are all related to each other and can be accessed by visiting a homepage.It is important to make sure that web applications download fast and are responsive to user interaction, regardless of a users bandwidth, screen size, network, or device capabilities.

            The intermediate Front End Skills include:
        <br>
        <h4>Responsive Design</h4>
            We use different gadgets like computers, phones, and tablets to look at web pages. The web pages adjust themselves to the device you’re using without any extra effort from your end. This is due to the responsive design. One major role of a front end developer is to understand the responsive design principles and how to implement them on the coding side. It is an intrinsic part of CSS frameworks like the Bootstrap. These skills are all interconnected and so as you learn one you’ll often be making progress in the others at the same time.
        <br>
        <h4>Build Tools</h4>
            The modern web browsers come equipped with developer tools for testing and debugging. These tools allow you to test the web pages in the browser itself and finds out how the page is interpreting the code. Browser developer tools usually consist of an inspector and a JavaScript console. The inspector allows you to see what the runtime HTML on your page looks like, what CSS is associated with each element on the page. The JS console allows you to view any errors that occur as the browser tries to execute your JS code.
        <br>

        <h4>Version Control/Git</h4>
            Version control is the process of tracking and controlling changes to your source code so that you don’t have to start from the beginning if anything goes wrong. It is a tool that is used to track the changes made previously so that you can go back to a previous version of your work and find out what went wrong without tearing the whole thing down.
        <br>
        <h3> Front End Frameworks</h3>

        <h4>HTML</h4>
            HyperText Markup Language(HTML) is the foundation of all websites. It’s the main file type that is loaded in your browser when you look at a website. This scripting language is used to structure the different parts of our content and define what their meaning or purpose is.
        <br>

            <h4>CSS</h4>
            Cascading Style Sheets(CSS) is used for styling the HTML elements. It provides 1000s of styling functions which are used to style the HTML elements defined by us. It is the language that we use to style and layout our web content.
        <br>
        <h4>JavaScript</h4>
            This programming language allows you to interact with elements on the website and to manipulate them. While CSS adds style to HTML, JavaScript adds interactivity and makes a website more dynamic.
